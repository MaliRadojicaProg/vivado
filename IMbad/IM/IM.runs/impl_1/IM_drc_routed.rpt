2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net imblk/cntrlU/en_s_reg_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin imblk/cntrlU/en_s_reg_i_2/O, cell imblk/cntrlU/en_s_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net imblk/cntrlU/en_x_reg_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin imblk/cntrlU/en_x_reg_i_2/O, cell imblk/cntrlU/en_x_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net imblk/cntrlU/en_y_reg_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin imblk/cntrlU/en_y_reg_i_1/O, cell imblk/cntrlU/en_y_reg_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net imblk/cntrlU/en_y_reg_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin imblk/cntrlU/en_y_reg_i_2/O, cell imblk/cntrlU/en_y_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#5 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net imblk/cntrlU/sel_add_reg_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin imblk/cntrlU/sel_add_reg_i_2/O, cell imblk/cntrlU/sel_add_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#6 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net imblk/dtpth/FSM_onehot_pr_state_reg[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin imblk/dtpth/sel_idle_reg_i_1/O, cell imblk/dtpth/sel_idle_reg_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#7 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net imblk/dtpth/FSM_onehot_pr_state_reg[2] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin imblk/dtpth/en_i_reg_i_1/O, cell imblk/dtpth/en_i_reg_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
